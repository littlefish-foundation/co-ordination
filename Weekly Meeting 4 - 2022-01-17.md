Ozgur explains his proposal on "Forest School Seed Funding".

Dimitri's second proposal Five Loaves Two Fish. 


### Voting

Vote to be held on these proposals
1. Collecting Animal Waste from Slaughterhouses for conversion into Petfood - Dimitri
2. Five Loaves Two Fish - Collecting Food Waste from  various Restaurants and Eating houses and distributing to Orphanages, Elders homes, street people and other beneficiaries - Dimitri
3. Voting & ID - ANONYMOUS Enabled, One Person equals One Vote
4. Forest School Seed Funding - Ozgur
5. The SDG Accelerator - Inner Development Goals - Discord: Emergies#5142
6. Support Plastic Pollution Fight in Malawi - Pike Ng'oma


We've decided on this process for the first vote:

Voting will be weighted. Each voter has three choices. Choice 1 will get 3 points, choice 2 will get 2 points and choice 3 will get 1 point. The proposal with the highest total points will be the winner.

The voting form was prepared during the meeting and the vote held semi anonymously. 

Agape Pool will top up our donations to 1000 ADA!!

### Reflections for Future Rounds

Next round will feature direct donations - maybe with smart contract support.

Specific details on how funds will be used should be added to proposals. 

Weighted voting for future iterations?

Use first cycle for marketing. #firstdonation #littlefish

connect proposals with sdgs - aim has an sdg tool already, mby we can leverage that.

### Impact Ledger

How do we create an impact ledger? Each project should have a clear, specific, auditable way of measuring impact. This is a key element of Littlefish's success. 

### Funding types & flowcharts explained


Miro board for funding mechanisms for Littlefish:

	sorry...power glitch.
22:15:14 From Melanie -Cardano4Climate To Everyone:
	Are we recording?
22:19:34 From Melanie -Cardano4Climate To Everyone:
	I am wondering if it would be helpful on future iterations to have photos & Prices for the items being purchased. And to break down the budget to show how the budget will be used.
22:25:22 From Dan Manning To Everyone:
	Is there 1000 ADA available or is the amount available the 657 that is on the pool.pm site?
22:31:36 From Dimitri Fernando To Everyone:
	Amount of Waste processed at present 150kg per day. Cookers to be purchased 10 cookers at rate of 70 USD per cooker (within this 1000 ADA). Rest would be used for the following - Transportation Cost per trip 30 USD. Labor Cost per Cooking cycle 100 USD per day. ( 2 to 3 adults at least needed).  
	If this is done on a daily basis the cost would be about 100 usd per day ( per 150kg) for the labor force of the cooking staff, whoever is doing the waste  collection ( driver, collector) and  distribution. Apart from this more costs are needed for packaging such as polythene packing for pet food. If this is to be done we will need to have a professional packing machine ( cost unknown). We would also have a special box for transporting this pet food so that vehicle does not get contaminated as the waste as well as the finished pet food is rich in oils and fats and can spill out, if its not properly packed. Part of the daily costs would also go for running costs of the vehicle including fuel/insurance as well as utili
