# co-ordination

Littlefish Foundation brings like-minded, like-hearted people together to work on practical applications of blockchain technology to address SDG issues. This starts by building a community that funds trusted activists around the globe who fight for SDG issues. It advances by building the infrastructure to automate the processes of the community by using blockchain technology. This requires working through a multitude of challenges, both technical and social. These efforts aim to establish a global network of activists and collaborators who support SDG efforts around the globe.

Some of the challenges we plan to work on will require the creation of general purpose DAO tools: 

- Funding mechanisms to build a treasury (donations and alternative blockchain funding systems like minting NFTs),

- Treasury management systems with voting to decide how funds are allocated,

And more tools specifically fit for SDG activism purposes:

- Fast decision making systems to rapidly respond to global crises like wildfires, earthquakes, etc.,

- Validation systems for establishing trust between activists on the ground and fund providers.
